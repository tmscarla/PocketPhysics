# Pocket Physiscs
An iOS app with physics lectures for high school, exercises, exam tests and utilities (in italian). It is the twin app of [Pocket Maths](https://github.com/tmscarla/pocket-maths/).

## Getting Started
At the moment, the app is no longer supported. In order to launch the application, just open the Xcode project file in the Project folder and select a compatible deployment target.

## Issues
The app was test with iOS 8 the last time. There might be some issues due to misplaced views in iPhone > 5S. 

## Screenshots
These are presentation screenshots of the application when it was on the App Store.
